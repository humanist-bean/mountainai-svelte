- google.cloud.aiplatform was installed into the "TensorflowEnv" Conda environment on PC. To make it work I downgraded protobuf from version 4.something to version 3.20.x. This was done with pip in the conda terminal, not from the conda ui.

- Installed gcloud cli with Google Cloud CLI installer for windows powershells
for: gcloud auth application-default login

- notes from gcloud setup:
* Commands that require authentication will use alderfrench1@gmail.com by default
* Commands will reference project `mountainai-392023` by default
* Compute Engine commands will use region `us-west1` by default
* Compute Engine commands will use zone `us-west1-b` by default

- tf model details (converted to tf from original fastai .pkl mountainai model):
Input layer name: input_1:0
Output layer name: Identity:0
Input shape: (1, 3, 256, 256)
Output shape: (1, 774)
